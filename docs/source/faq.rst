Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Get answers to the most common questions about LogicPwn, from basic setup to advanced enterprise deployment scenarios.

üöÄ Getting Started
-----------------

**Q: What makes LogicPwn different from other security testing tools?**

A: LogicPwn is specifically designed for **business logic vulnerability testing**, which traditional scanners miss. Key differences:

- **Business Process Understanding**: LogicPwn comprehends multi-step workflows, not just individual requests
- **Advanced Session Management**: Handles complex authentication flows, CSRF tokens, and session persistence automatically
- **Async Architecture**: Concurrent testing capabilities for improved performance
- **Python-Native**: Code-first approach enables unlimited customization and CI/CD integration
- **Multi-Protocol Auth**: Native support for OAuth 2.0, SAML, JWT, and MFA

**Q: Do I need programming experience to use LogicPwn?**

A: Basic Python knowledge is recommended but not required to get started:

- **Beginners**: Use pre-built validation presets and example configurations
- **Intermediate**: Customize authentication flows and validation rules  
- **Advanced**: Build custom exploit chains and integrate with enterprise systems

**Q: How long does it take to set up LogicPwn for a new application?**

A: Setup time depends on application complexity:

- **Simple web apps**: 15-30 minutes using built-in presets
- **Complex authentication**: 1-2 hours to configure multi-step flows
- **Enterprise integration**: 1-2 days for full CI/CD integration

**Q: Can LogicPwn test both web applications and APIs?**

A: Yes, LogicPwn excels at both:

.. code-block:: python

   # Web application testing
   web_auth = AuthConfig(
       url="https://app.example.com/login",
       credentials={"username": "user", "password": "pass"},
       success_indicators=["Welcome", "Dashboard"]
   )
   
   # API testing  
   api_auth = AuthConfig(
       url="https://api.example.com/auth/login",
       credentials={"email": "user@example.com", "password": "pass"},
       success_indicators=["access_token", "expires_in"],
       auth_type="bearer_token"
   )

üîß Technical Questions
---------------------

üîß Troubleshooting
-----------------

**Q: LogicPwn authentication keeps failing. How do I debug this?**

A: Authentication issues are common with new setups. Try these debugging steps:

.. code-block:: python

   # Enable debug logging
   import logging
   from loguru import logger
   
   # Set up comprehensive logging
   logger.add("debug.log", level="DEBUG", rotation="10 MB")
   logging.getLogger("logicpwn").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   
   # Test authentication step by step
   auth_config = AuthConfig(
       url="https://your-app.com/login",
       credentials={"username": "test", "password": "test"},
       success_indicators=["welcome", "dashboard"],
       failure_indicators=["invalid", "error"],
       debug=True  # Enable debug mode
   )
   
   # Manual authentication testing
   validator = AuthenticatedValidator(auth_config, "https://your-app.com")
   
   # Check each step
   print("1. Testing connectivity...")
   response = validator.session.get("https://your-app.com/login")
   print(f"   Status: {response.status_code}")
   
   print("2. Testing authentication...")
   auth_result = validator.authenticate()
   print(f"   Success: {auth_result}")
   
   if not auth_result:
       print("3. Checking authentication response...")
       # Manual login attempt with detailed logging
       login_response = validator.session.post(
           "https://your-app.com/login",
           data={"username": "test", "password": "test"}
       )
       print(f"   Response: {login_response.text[:200]}")

**Q: My tests are running very slowly. How can I optimize performance?**

A: Several optimization strategies can dramatically improve performance:

.. code-block:: python

   # Performance optimization techniques
   
   # 1. Use async execution for multiple requests
   async def optimized_testing():
       async with AsyncSessionManager() as manager:
           # Parallel execution instead of sequential
           tasks = [
               manager.send_request("GET", f"/api/endpoint/{i}")
               for i in range(100)
           ]
           results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
   
   # 2. Enable response caching
   from logicpwn.core.cache import response_cache
   
   @response_cache.cache(expire=300)  # Cache for 5 minutes
   def cached_request(url):
       return send_request(url=url, method="GET")
   
   # 3. Optimize concurrent connections
   stress_config = StressTestConfig(
       max_concurrent=50,        # Start with 50, increase gradually
       connection_pool_size=20,  # Reuse connections
       keep_alive=True,         # HTTP keep-alive
       compress=True            # Enable compression
   )

**Q: How do I handle applications with complex CSRF protection?**

A: LogicPwn includes advanced CSRF handling capabilities:

.. code-block:: python

   # Advanced CSRF configuration
   csrf_config = CSRFConfig(
       enabled=True,
       token_name="csrf_token",
       auto_include=True,
       refresh_on_failure=True,
       
       # Multiple extraction patterns for different applications
       extraction_patterns=[
           r'name="csrf_token" value="([^"]+)"',           # Form fields
           r'<meta name="csrf-token" content="([^"]+)"',   # Meta tags
           r'"csrf_token":"([^"]+)"',                      # JSON responses
           r'window\.csrf_token = "([^"]+)"'               # JavaScript variables
       ],
       
       # Custom injection locations
       injection_locations=["form_data", "headers", "query_params"],
       
       # Handle token expiration
       expiry_detection_patterns=[
           "token expired", "csrf mismatch", "invalid token"
       ]
   )
