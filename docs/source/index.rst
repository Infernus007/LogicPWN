What is LogicPwn?
-----------------

LogicPwn is a powerful Python framework for **business logic exploitation** and **exploit chaining automation**. It's designed for security professionals who need to:

* **Automate complex attack chains** with persistent sessions
* **Test business logic vulnerabilities** systematically  
* **Scale security testing** with async/parallel execution
* **Validate responses** with advanced pattern matching
* **Monitor performance** and cache results for efficiency

Key Features
------------

**üîê Advanced Authentication**
   * Session persistence and management
   * Multi-step authentication workflows
   * Secure credential handling with redaction

**‚ö° High-Performance Execution**
   * Async/parallel request processing
   * Connection pooling and rate limiting
   * Batch request execution

**üîç Intelligent Response Validation**
   * Multi-criteria validation (keywords, regex, status codes)
   * Vulnerability pattern detection
   * Data extraction with regex patterns
   * Confidence scoring for validation results

**üìä Performance & Monitoring**
   * Real-time performance metrics
   * Response caching for efficiency
   * Memory and CPU monitoring
   * Comprehensive logging with security

**üõ°Ô∏è Security-First Design**
   * Secure logging with data redaction
   * Comprehensive error handling
   * Input validation and sanitization
   * Rate limiting and throttling

Quick Start
-----------

Install LogicPwn:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install logicpwn[async]

Basic usage:

.. code-block:: python

   from logicpwn.core import authenticate_session, send_request
   
   # Configure authentication
   auth_config = {
       "url": "https://target.com/login",
       "credentials": {"username": "admin", "password": "secret"},
       "success_indicators": ["dashboard", "welcome"]
   }
   
   # Authenticate and chain exploits
   session = authenticate_session(auth_config)
   response = session.get("https://target.com/admin/panel")
   print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")

Advanced async execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import asyncio
   from logicpwn.core import AsyncSessionManager
   
   async def exploit_chain():
       async with AsyncSessionManager() as manager:
           await manager.authenticate(auth_config)
           results = await manager.send_requests_batch(request_configs)
           for result in results:
               print(f"Request: {result.status_code}")
   
   asyncio.run(exploit_chain())

Installation
------------

LogicPwn requires Python 3.9+ and can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install logicpwn[async]

For development installation:
