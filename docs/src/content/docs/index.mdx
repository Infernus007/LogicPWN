## Features

LogicPWN is a comprehensive security testing framework that provides:

- **Access Control Testing**: Detect IDOR vulnerabilities and privilege escalation
- **Authentication Testing**: Test various authentication mechanisms
- **Performance Testing**: Stress testing and rate limiting
- **Exploit Engine**: Chain exploits and validate security controls
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed security reports
- **Async Support**: High-performance concurrent testing

## Quick Example

```python
from logicpwn.core.access import detect_idor_flaws
from logicpwn.core.auth import AuthConfig
from logicpwn.core.runner import AsyncRequestRunner

# Configure authentication
auth_config = AuthConfig(
    username="admin",
    password="password"
)

# Detect IDOR vulnerabilities
async def test_access_control():
    async with AsyncRequestRunner() as runner:
        results = await detect_idor_flaws(
            runner=runner,
            base_url="https://example.com",
            auth_config=auth_config,
            test_endpoints=["/api/users/1", "/api/users/2"]
        )

        for result in results:
            print(f"Vulnerability: {result.vulnerability_type}")
            print(f"Severity: {result.severity}")
            print(f"Details: {result.details}")
```
