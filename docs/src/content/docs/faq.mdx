    }
)
```

## Usage Questions

### How do I test for IDOR vulnerabilities?

```python
from logicpwn.core.access import detect_idor_flaws
from logicpwn.core.runner import AsyncRequestRunner

async def test_idor():
    async with AsyncRequestRunner() as runner:
        results = await detect_idor_flaws(
            runner=runner,
            base_url="https://example.com",
            auth_config=auth_config,
            test_endpoints=[
                "/api/users/1",
                "/api/users/2",
                "/api/users/3"
            ]
        )

        for result in results:
            if result.is_vulnerable:
                print(f"IDOR found: {result.endpoint}")
```

### How do I run performance tests?

```python
from logicpwn.core.stress import StressTester

async def performance_test():
    async with AsyncRequestRunner() as runner:
        stress_config = {
            "concurrent_users": 100,
            "requests_per_user": 10,
            "test_duration": 60
        }

        results = await StressTester(runner).run_stress_test(
            base_url="https://example.com",
            config=stress_config
        )

        return results
```

### How do I configure rate limiting?

```python
from logicpwn.core.reliability import AdaptiveRateLimiter, RateLimitConfig

# Configure rate limiting
rate_config = RateLimitConfig(
    requests_per_second=5,
    burst_size=10
)

rate_limiter = AdaptiveRateLimiter(rate_config)

# Use with runner
async with AsyncRequestRunner(rate_limiter=rate_limiter) as runner:
    # Your requests here
    pass
```

## Configuration Questions

### How do I set up environment variables?

```bash
# Set default configuration
export LOGICPWN_BASE_URL="https://your-app.com"
export LOGICPWN_USERNAME="test-user"
export LOGICPWN_PASSWORD="test-password"
export LOGICPWN_TIMEOUT="30"
export LOGICPWN_MAX_CONCURRENT="10"
```

### How do I create a configuration file?

Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
base_url: "https://your-app.com"
auth:
  username: "test-user"
  password: "test-password"
runner:
  timeout: 30
  max_concurrent: 10
  retry_attempts: 3
access_testing:
  test_endpoints:
    - "/api/users/{id}"
    - "/api/orders/{id}"
    - "/api/profile"
```

### How do I configure SSL/TLS settings?

```python
import requests
from logicpwn.core.runner import AsyncRequestRunner

# Configure SSL settings
ssl_config = {
    "verify": True,  # Verify SSL certificates
    "cert": ("client.crt", "client.key"),  # Client certificates
    "timeout": 30
}

# Use with requests session
session = requests.Session()
session.verify = ssl_config["verify"]
session.cert = ssl_config["cert"]
session.timeout = ssl_config["timeout"]

# Use with runner
async with AsyncRequestRunner(session=session) as runner:
    # Your requests here
    pass
```

</CardGrid>

### Import Errors

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'logicpwn'`

**Solution**: Install LogicPWN properly:
```bash
pip install logicpwn
# or
poetry add logicpwn
```

**Problem**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'detect_idor_flaws'`

**Solution**: Use correct import path:
```python
# Correct
from logicpwn.core.access import detect_idor_flaws

# Incorrect
from logicpwn.access import detect_idor_flaws
```

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Authentication always fails

**Solution**: Check your credentials and headers:
```python
# Test authentication first
async def test_auth():
    async with AsyncRequestRunner() as runner:
        response = await runner.send_request(
            "GET",
            "https://example.com/api/profile",
            auth_config=auth_config
        )
        print(f"Auth test status: {response.status_code}")
```

**Problem**: Custom headers not working

**Solution**: Verify header format:
```python
# Correct
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "your-api-key",
    "Authorization": "Bearer your-token"
}

# Incorrect
headers = {
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key",  # Case sensitive
    "authorization": "Bearer your-token"
}
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Requests timing out

**Solution**: Increase timeout values:
```python
async with AsyncRequestRunner(timeout=60) as runner:
    # Your requests here
```

**Problem**: Memory usage too high

**Solution**: Reduce concurrent requests:
```python
async with AsyncRequestRunner(max_concurrent=5) as runner:
    # Your requests here
```

**Problem**: Rate limiting errors

**Solution**: Configure rate limiting:
```python
rate_config = RateLimitConfig(
    requests_per_second=2,  # Reduce rate
    burst_size=5
)
```

## Integration Questions

### How do I integrate with CI/CD?

```python
import os
import sys

async def ci_test():
    results = await detect_idor_flaws(
        runner=runner,
        base_url=os.getenv("TEST_URL"),
        auth_config=AuthConfig(
            username=os.getenv("TEST_USER"),
            password=os.getenv("TEST_PASSWORD")
        ),
        test_endpoints=load_test_endpoints()
    )

    # Fail build if vulnerabilities found
    vulnerabilities = [r for r in results if r.is_vulnerable]
    if vulnerabilities:
        print(f"❌ Found {len(vulnerabilities)} vulnerabilities")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("✅ No vulnerabilities found")
```

### How do I generate reports?

```python
from logicpwn.core.reporter import ReportGenerator

async def generate_report():
    # Run tests
    results = await detect_idor_flaws(...)

    # Generate report
    report = ReportGenerator()
    report_data = report.generate_report(
        results=results,
        format="json"  # or "html", "markdown"
    )

    # Save report
    with open("security_report.json", "w") as f:
        f.write(report_data)
```

### How do I use with other security tools?

```python
# Example integration with custom security scanner
class CustomSecurityScanner:
    def __init__(self, logicpwn_runner):
        self.runner = logicpwn_runner

    async def scan(self, url):
        # Use LogicPWN for access testing
        access_results = await detect_idor_flaws(
            runner=self.runner,
            base_url=url,
            auth_config=auth_config
        )

        # Combine with other security tests
        combined_results = {
            "access_control": access_results,
            "other_tests": await self.other_tests(url)
        }

        return combined_results
```

## Security Questions
